INFORMATION
=========
 * It assumes that you will do a /dumpraid at some point
 * It assumes the format for loot in the designated loot channel:  [Player] - [Item] - ##
 * The rift log file does not store date and times and the time is stored in GMT time.  The parser will cater for this by converting log times to local time and assuming the time you put in the parser interface is local time.
